PCBS Project: Ecological assessment of probability heuristics
============================================================================================
## Introduction 
Kahneman&Tversky (1973) provided some important insight into how people deal with probability tasks in which they have to integrate prior probabilities with specific evidence. One of the most famous experiments of that study, "Lawyers and Engineers" (henceforth L&E) was constructed as follows. People are given a description corresponding to an invidivual which was randomly chosen from a group of 100 people.
