PCBS Project: Ecological assessment of probability heuristics
============================================================================================
## Introduction 
Kahneman&Tversky (1973) provided some important insight into how people deal with probability tasks in which they have to integrate prior probabilities with specific evidence. One of the most famous experiments of that study, "Lawyers and Engineers" (henceforth L&E) was constructed as follows. People were given a description corresponding to an invidivual which was randomly chosen from a sample of 100 people. There were two experimental conditions:
+ One group of subjects was told that the sample consisted of 70 engineers and 30 lawyers.
+ The other group of subjects was told that the sample consisted of 30 engineers and 70 lawyers.
The description were like the following:
> «Jack is a 45-year-old man. He is married and has four children. He is generally conservative, careful, and ambitious. He shows no interest in political and social issues and spends most of his free time on his many hobbies which include home carpentry, sailing, and mathematical puzzles.»
Then, subjects were asked to write down the probability that the subject was one of the 30 (or 70, respectively) engineers. 

The results was that subjects produced essentially the same probability judgments. From this, Tversky and Kahneman concluded that subjects evaluated the likelihood that a specific description belonged to an engineer rather than to a lawyer by the degree to which this description was representative of the two stereotypes, with little or no regard for the prior probabilities of the categories. 

But how do we know that for people the description isn't _so strongly_ in favor of the engineer-hypothesis that this pressure _rationally_ bumps the priors in the bayesian computation? To wit, if for instance we are asked to whom the description "has antennas" corresponds in a set of 99 earthlings and 1 alien, answering "the alien" would not mean disregarding the priors. To assess this, we are replicating the experiment by trying to model the data through naive probabilities collected in an already performed norming study. 

To clarify, given Bayes' theorem, $P(h|e) = [P(e|h) * P(h)] / P(e)$ we call:

In the norming study,  we collected information on the naive priors on the hypotheses as well as on the likelihood and the posterior probability.
